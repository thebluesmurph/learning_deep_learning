# learning_deep_learning
My shenanigans while learning deep learning with PyTorch. This repository contains my personal notes as I work through resources. It includes tutorials, scripts, and small projects exploring CNNs, autograd, and image classification.

## Contents

- `scripts/` — Python scripts from tutorials (e.g., CIFAR10, MNIST)  
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks with interactive experiments  
- `notes/` — Written notes, explanations, and reflections on concepts  

## Lesson Notes / Projects Included

- **PyTorch Blitz** — Beginner tutorials following the official PyTorch tutorials (source: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/)
- **Image Classifiers** — Convolutional Neural Networks trained on CIFAR10  
- **Autograd Experiments** — Playing with gradients, backward passes, and Jacobians  

## Getting Started

### Requirements
Make sure you have Python 3.x and the following packages installed:
torch
torchvision
numpy
matplotlib
